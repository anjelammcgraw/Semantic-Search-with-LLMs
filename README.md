# 🤖 Semantic Search with LLMS

In this repo, we'll enhance key word search with Cohere Rerank and use embeddings to leverage dense retrieval and evaluate effectiveness with optimization. 

### ⚙️The colab link to the code is found and (will also be included in this repo) [here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OR0dpmer4AFPwvKvA3e5dW8C_lU8o2D3?usp=sharing)

# ⚙️The Build Process (Deliverables)

### Build 🏗️

* Work with a large amount of data
* Implement basic **keyword search**
* Enchance keyword search with **rerank method** (ranks best responses by relevance with the query) 
* Implement **dense retrieval** using embeddings (uses actual semantic meaning of the text to carry out search/improve results)
* Implement language model-powered search
